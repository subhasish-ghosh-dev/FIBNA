It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

      "Cancer cells have the ability to alter their gene expression to adapt to the microenvironment and to evade the immune system. In this study, we used a novel RNA sequencing method to identify the differentially expressed genes in PC cells and analyzed the correlation between these genes and the clinical characteristics of PC patients. We found that the expression of 19 genes was differentially expressed between PC cells and normal pancreatic cells. Among them, 12 genes were upregulated in PC cells and 7 genes were downregulated. The differentially expressed genes were involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The expression of 4 genes was correlated with the clinical characteristics of PC patients. The expression of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis was higher in PC cells than in normal pancreatic cells. The expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle was higher in PC cells than in normal pancreatic cells. These results suggest that the expression of differentially expressed genes in PC cells may be associated with the adaptation of PC cells to the microenvironment and the evasion of the immune system.\n",

      "Between 1998 and 2009, 38 children with primary microcephaly were examined at the University Children's Hospital in Prague. Microcephaly was defined as a head circumference (HC) in the third percentile (i.e., 3rd percentile of the distribution of HC in the Czech population) or below. The diagnosis of primary microcephaly was made according to the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 and 11. All patients were examined in the 3rd year of life. The diagnosis of microcephaly was made in 33 children, and the diagnosis of microcephaly with a family history of microcephaly was made in 5 children. The mean age at diagnosis was 2.8 \\(\\pm\\) 1.6 years. The mean age at diagnosis in the 5 children with microcephaly with a family history of microcephaly was 1.8 \\(\\pm\\) 1.4 years. In all patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound. The diagnosis of microcephaly was confirmed by ultrasonography in 33 children, and the diagnosis of microcephaly with a family history of microcephaly was confirmed in 5 children.\n",

Paeoniflorin also significantly inhibited the production of the inflammatory mediators and increased the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase in the brains of the mice with alzheimers disease.

      "In 1991 the cloning of the insulin receptor was reported the insulin receptor was initially cloned as a 220kDa protein that was found to be a receptor for insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF) [1]. Subsequently it was shown that the insulin receptor is also a receptor for the IGFs [2]. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that binds insulin and IGFs and transduces the signal to the cell [3]. The insulin receptor is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits A and B the A subunit is a 140kDa protein and the B subunit is a 95kDa protein the two subunits are linked by a disulfide bond the B subunit is responsible for the transmembrane and the A subunit is responsible for the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity [4]. The insulin receptor is a receptor for IGFs which are secreted glycoproteins with a molecular weight of 30-40kDa [5]. IGFs are the major regulators of cell growth and differentiation the IGFs bind to the IGF receptor (IGF1R) the IGF1R is a 170kDa protein that is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits A and B [6]. The A subunit is a 95kDa protein and the B subunit is a 45kDa protein the two subunits are linked by a disulfide bond [7]. The A subunit is responsible for the transmembrane and the B subunit is responsible for the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity [8].

      "BALB/c mice (5-6 weeks old) were purchased from the National Institute of Animal Science (Korean National Bioresource Center, Seoul, Korea). The mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST, Seoul, Korea) and fed with autoclaved commercial diet and autoclaved water ad libitum. The animals were acclimated for 1 week before the experiments were performed.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
