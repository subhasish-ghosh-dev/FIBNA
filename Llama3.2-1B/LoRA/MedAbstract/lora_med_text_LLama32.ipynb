Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Eight otherwise asymptomatic snorers (seven male and one female), age 39 +/- 5.3 yr (mean +/- SEM), underwent overnight sleep studies on three successive nights. An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3). The duration of OAH was similar on both study nights (20 +/- 1.9 s during C versus 20 +/- 1.5 s during OPA). The frequency of movement arousals terminating OAH tended to be higher during OPA (7 +/- 2.9/h) than during C (3 +/- 0.7); P = NS. The frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturations was also higher during OPA (5 +/- 2.1/h) than during C (3 +/- 1.4), p less than 0.07. \n",

Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Twenty-three patients with obstructive sleep apnea and 23 control subjects underwent polysomnography. Patients were selected for the study on the basis of a loud snoring score of greater than 20 and a sleep apnea index of greater than 5/hour. The presence of upper airway obstruction was confirmed by the presence of obstructive apneas (defined as an apnea with an airflow less than 15% of the predicted normal) and hypopneas (defined as a reduction in airflow of less than 50% of the predicted normal). Patients with obstructive sleep apnea were randomized to receive either a topical oropharyngeal anesthetic agent, 0.5% lidocaine, or a placebo. Patients were then monitored for 24 hours in a sleep laboratory. The results demonstrated that the topical anesthetic agents were not effective in decreasing upper airway obstruction in the patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The results of this study suggest that the upper airway reflex mechanism may be an important factor in the development of obstructive sleep apnea. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 83: 109-112. 1995.

In a consecutive entry trial, the incidence and time course of decreased neutrophil function was assessed in 20 patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of low neutrophil function for late pyogenic infections. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytic-bactericidal activity were studied before and 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after BMT. Skin window migration was quantitatively assessed 2 months after BMT. Infectious complications were recorded prospectively with preset criteria during 1 year. Six of the 20 leukemic patients had defective neutrophil function before BMT. Two months after BMT all 10 patients with greater than stage II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 6 of 10 patients with less than or equal to stage II GVHD had at least one decreased function. At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function. In conclusion, neutrophil function is frequently impaired during the first months after BMT. Combined neutrophil defects predispose to pyogenic infections and indicate the patient at risk. \n",

Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination. \n",

      "Reference Text: Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms. \n",

This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors from 36 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 15 with recurrent hyperparathyroidism, and 15 with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry, and DNA ploidy was determined by both flow cytometry and a classical cytogenetic method. Tumors from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA content values ranging from 46 to 78 (mean, 63.7 +/- 2.2) and were classified as aneuploid in 23 (64%) of 36 tumors. Tumors from patients with recurrent hyperparathyroidism were also aneuploid in 14 (93%) of 15 tumors, and tumors from patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 were also aneuploid in 9 (60%) of 15 tumors. DNA ploidy of parathyroid tumors was determined by flow cytometry in 18 tumors and by classical cytogenetic analysis in 18 tumors. The DNA ploidy of 18 tumors was determined as aneuploid in 15 (83%) of 18 tumors by flow cytometry and as aneuploid in 15 (83%) of 18 tumors by classical cytogenetic analysis. The flow cytometric DNA ploidy and classical cytogenetic DNA ploidy values of parathyroid tumors were highly correlated (r = 0.85, P < 0.0001). The DNA ploidy of parathyroid tumors is an independent predictor of the pathologic and biologic classification of these tumors.

The histologic characteristics of WT include a mononuclear cell infiltrate, a high mitotic rate, and a high rate of spontaneous regression. WT cells have been reported to express a variety of immunologic markers, including class II antigens, IL-1, and HLA-DR. In this study, we investigated the expression of class II antigens and IL-1 in WT cells and the relationship between the expression of these markers and the rate of spontaneous regression. 2. Materials and methods WT cells were obtained from a 68-year-old man with WT. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. The culture medium was changed every 2 days.

      "Reference Text: Questionable role of CNS radioprophylaxis in the therapeutic management of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma with meningeal extension. A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. \n",

      "Reference Text: Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis in experimentally induced cholestasis in rat. The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid. \n",

Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography. \n",

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome. MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle. \n",

MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ concentration. The mechanism by which this abnormality occurs is unknown. In the present study, we used the technique of Ca++ microfluorimetry to examine sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca++ regulatory site defect in MH pig muscle. SR Ca++ regulatory sites were identified by a technique that is based on the ability of SR Ca++ to bind Ca++ to a fluorescent probe. SR Ca++ regulatory sites were identified in the SR of MH pig muscle by the technique of Ca++ microfluorimetry. The Ca++ regulatory sites were identified as a function of the presence of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (1,2-DG) and the absence of the SR Ca++ regulatory site blocker, ruthenium red. The Ca++ regulatory site defect was specific to SR Ca++ regulatory sites and was not observed in other SR Ca++ regulatory sites, such as the SR Ca++ ATPase or SR Ca++ binding protein. The SR Ca++ regulatory site defect was specific to the SR Ca++ regulatory site in the sarcoplasmic reticulum from MH pig muscle.

The roles of classical modifiers of central chemical drive to breathing (H+ and cholinergic mechanisms) are summarized. A brief perspective on the current widespread interest in GABA and glutamate in central control is given. The basic biochemistry of these amino acids and their roles in ammonia and bicarbonate metabolism are discussed. This review further addresses recent work on central respiratory effects of inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate. Current understanding of the sites and mechanisms of action of these amino acids on or near the ventral surface of the medulla is reviewed. We focus particularly on tracer kinetic investigations of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude with some speculative remarks on the critical importance of these investigations and suggest specific directions of research in central mechanisms of respiratory control. \n",

      "Reference Text: A useful technique for measurement of back strength in osteoporotic and elderly patients. Improvement of back extensor strength (BES) can be used as a therapeutic method for patients with chronic back pain and osteoporosis. The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer (BID-2000) designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change, increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES, we tested 50 normal, healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position, maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient, and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe, reliable (coefficient of variation = 2.33%), and valid (P = 0.001) method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate, steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade. \n",

The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and by different routes. Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment. This suggests that more than one process may contribute to the pathogenesis of herpes labialis. \n",

The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and in different ways. The results of this study show that the use of UVR and ACV in the treatment of sun-induced herpes labialis is effective. The clinical response to UVR and ACV was similar in the 5 groups of patients. However, the patients treated with UVR and ACV showed a significantly greater reduction in the size of the lesions than did those treated with placebo. The results of this study show that UVR and ACV are effective in the treatment of sun-induced herpes labialis. 1. Introduction. Herpes simplex labialis (HSV-L) is a common viral infection of the lips and is characterized by the development of a painful, ulcerative lesion in the center of the lips. The development of this lesion is believed to be a result of a herpes virus (HSV) infection of the epithelial cells of the lips. This infection is believed to be caused by the sun's ultraviolet radiation (UVR) because it is known that UVR induces the formation of the HSV-L in the human skin. 2. Methods. Patients with a history of sun-induced HSV-L were recruited from the outpatient clinics of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMC). The patients were divided into 5 groups according to the time of exposure to UVR and the route of administration of ACV. The groups were: (1) Group 1--UVR and ACV; (2) Group 2--UVR only; (3) Group 3--UVR and placebo; (4) Group 4--UVR and ACV; and (5) Group 5--UVR and placebo. 3. Results. The results of this study are presented in Table 1. The results of this study show that the use of UVR and ACV in the treatment of sun-induced HSV-L is effective.

A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. \n",

The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues. \n",

      "Reference Text: Appraisal of gut lavage in the study of intestinal humoral immunity. Direct investigation of intestinal humoral immunity requires collection of intestinal secretions or mucosal biopsy specimens, or both. A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease. \n",

The intestinal mucosal immune system consists of both cellular and humoral components. The cellular immune system consists of a number of different cell types, including lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The humoral immune system consists of antibodies, which are produced by B lymphocytes, and complement, which is produced by plasma cells. 2. METHODS. The intestinal mucosal immune system is studied by the following methods: 1. The assay of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and secretory immunoglobulin G (sIgG) antibodies. 2. The assay of secretory IgA and IgG enzymes. 3. The study of the intestinal mucosal immune response in patients with Crohn's disease. 3.1.

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts. \n",

      "Reference Text: Bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated thrombolytic infusions for myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and is now widely used in such patients. The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on regional preferences. The standard dose of streptokinase is 1.5 million units over 60 min, and the dose of rt-PA that is commonly used is 100 mg over 3 h. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. Based on these studies, there have been a number of recent trials examining alternative dosage regimens for rt-PA (bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated) in patients with myocardial infarction. To date, there is no convincing evidence that such regimens are superior to the more traditional rt-PA regimen. Future randomized trials will determine whether attempts to optimize rt-PA regimens will result in more efficacious treatment regimens. Interest in the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism has been rekindled. The traditional 12- to 24-h regimens of streptokinase and urokinase are not optimal because of their logistic complexity and associated hemorrhagic complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h, is an effective thrombolytic agent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In a recent double-blind trial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg infused over 2 min, improved pulmonary perfusion. This bolus regimen is attractive because it is simple to administer. Future studies will compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two rt-PA regimens in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. \n",

Thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and is now widely used in such patients. The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on a number of considerations. We have compared the efficacy of bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated thrombolytic infusions for acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction and 20 patients with acute pulmonary embolism were randomly assigned to receive either a 2-hour infusion of 1.5 mg/kg of streptokinase or 1 mg/kg of rt-PA. In the myocardial infarction group, the thrombolytic agent was given within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain. In the pulmonary embolism group, the thrombolytic agent was given within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. The primary endpoint was the composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary endpoints included the number of patients with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and the number of patients with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic diameter. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the primary endpoint. In the myocardial infarction group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower mortality rate with the accelerated thrombolytic infusion. In the pulmonary embolism group, there were no significant differences in the primary endpoint. In conclusion, accelerated thrombolytic infusions are not superior to front-loaded or bolus thrombolytic infusions for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction or acute pulmonary embolism. 1990 Academic Press, Inc. 0002-9343/90/0102-0007$02.50/0\n",

      "Reference Text: Effects of site-specific mutations on biologic activities of recombinant human IL-6. To examine structure-activity relationships of human IL-6, we have determined the effects of specific mutations on the biologic activity of a human rIL-6 expressed in bacteria. Three types of mutants were examined: 1) a variant that contains serines in place of the four naturally occurring cysteines; 2) a series of cysteine-containing deletion mutants, each having a single internal 20 amino acid deletion; and 3) a cysteine-free variant containing a single 20 amino acid deletion. The mutants of the second type constitute a set of nonoverlapping, adjacent deletions spanning amino acids 4 through 183 of the 184 amino acids in natural human IL-6. All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker. This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps. Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels. The sp. ac. of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line. Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%. These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6. Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays. These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested. \n",

      "Reference Text: Prophylactic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices: long-term results of a single-center trial. Survival after prophylactic sclerotherapy was assessed in a single-center study involving 99 cirrhotic (41 alcoholic) patients enrolled over 8-yr. The wedged hepatic vein pressure gradient was measured; those with pressure greater than or equal to 12 mm Hg were randomized to receive sclerotherapy or no treatment. The rest were not randomized. Patients in all three groups who bled were treated with emergency endoscopy and sclerotherapy. Stratification according to presence of ascites was also undertaken. Median follow-up was 61 mo (range = 14 to 107 mo). Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference. \n",

      "Reference Text: Leukaemia complicating treatment for Hodgkin's disease: the experience of the British National Lymphoma Investigation. OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of and risk factors for the development of secondary acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia in patients treated in British National Lymphoma Investigation's studies of Hodgkin's disease since 1970. PATIENTS--2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS--17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. \n",

The incidence of leukaemia was significantly greater in patients treated with combination chemotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone (P = 0.0001). Leukaemia developed significantly more often in patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P = 0.0001). Leukaemia developed significantly more often in patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P = 0.0001). The risk of developing leukaemia increased with the duration of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--The incidence of leukaemia is significantly greater in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease than in patients treated for other cancers. Leukaemia develops significantly more often in patients treated with combination chemotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Leukaemia develops significantly more often in patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy than in patients treated with radiotherapy alone.

      "Reference Text: Tissue dose estimates following the selective uptake of 125IUdR and other radiolabelled thymidine precursors in resistant tumours. For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose to any tissue from the radionuclide 125I is not simple, since the major emissions are very short-range Auger electrons. The cytotoxicity of 125I is strongly dependent on the position of the decay relative to the DNA, the principal target for cell sterilization. Estimates of the cytotoxicity of 125I based on the traditional MIRD recommended formulation (ICRU Report 32, 1979) may produce gross underestimates if it is incorporated into the DNA via the thymidine precursor 125IUdR. In this work, tissue count and autoradiography (ARG) data from studies by Bagshawe et al were used to estimate tissue doses following the administration of 125IUdR to LS174/T (a colorectal carcinoma) and CC3 (a choriocarcinoma) tumour-bearing animals, after a hydroxyurea block of the normal tissue turnover. The tumour cell toxicity is estimated from ARG data on the degree of 125I incorporation into the cell nucleus. Major drawbacks with 125I for this type of therapy are the long 60-day half-life, leading to radiological and waste disposal problems and the extreme short range of the radiotoxic effects. Possible alternative radiohalogens, 13I, 77Br, 131I and 211At, are suggested in place of 125I in the thymidine analog iododeoxyuridine. Dose calculations are performed and cytotoxicities estimated on the assumption that their biological retention characteristics are the same as for 125IUdR. \n",

For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose distribution in a tumour and normal tissue, the tumour dose was calculated as the product of the absorbed dose and the tumour fraction, and the normal tissue dose was calculated as the product of the absorbed dose and the normal tissue fraction. The tumour dose was calculated for the tumour volume and the normal tissue dose for the normal tissue volume. The tumour dose and normal tissue dose were then compared to determine the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio. The tumour dose was compared to the normal tissue dose and the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio to determine the tumour dose and normal tissue dose to tumour dose ratio. The results of these calculations are compared to the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio for 125IUdR and to the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio for 32P and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine in the literature. The results show that the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio for 125IUdR is higher than the tumour dose to normal tissue ratio for 32P and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine physiologic responses and efficacy of 2, 1, and 1 mg/kg IM meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (MPC), respectively, in children. DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded trial. SETTING: A university and community emergency department. PATIENTS: Sixty-three hemodynamically and neurologically stable children. INTERVENTION: Single dose of IM MPC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial respirations, heart rate, arterial systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Glasgow Coma Scale were measured at 30-minute intervals. Effectiveness was assessed by two independent observers using separate visual analog scales for cooperation and sedation. Times to sleep (27 +/- 24 minutes), sitting upright (103 +/- 87 minutes), ED discharge (4.7 +/- 2.4 hours), eating (11 +/- 7.9 hours), and normal behavior (19 +/- 15 hours) were acceptable. Minor, but statistically significant, changes in respiration rate (-1.9 +/- 0.4), heart rate (+4.5 +/- 1.8), oxygen saturation (-0.7 +/- 0.3%), and Glasgow Coma Scale (-2.5 +/- 0.6) occurred for 120 minutes after MPC. No serious complications or resuscitation were required. Mean visual analog scale scores were 5.0/10.4 or more in 71% of cases, with interobserver agreement very good (cooperation, r = .79; effectiveness, r = .80). Twenty-nine percent of children were judged insufficiently sedated. CONCLUSION: IM MPC is a safe and generally effective agent for ED procedures in selected children. \n",

Twenty-six evaluable children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who failed to achieve initial remission after receiving two to seven drugs for at least a 4-week period were given teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered. \n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM. In the presence of exogenously added CaM, lipidic extracts from the SHM heart showed augmented CaM-PDE activity relative to normotensive preparations. This difference was eliminated by trifluoperazine. \n",

The hypertensive rats were given a high-sodium diet (HS) or a low-sodium diet (LS) for 2 weeks and then fed a control diet (CD) for another 2 weeks. The rats were then killed and their kidneys were removed for CaM activator determination. The CaM activator levels were higher in the SHR and Dahl than in WKY and were also higher in the HS than in the LS group. The CaM activator levels were not affected by the CD in any of the groups. The CaM activator levels were higher in the HS than in the LS group in WKY and SHR. The CaM activator levels in the LS group were not different from those in the WKY. The CaM activator levels in the HS and LS groups were not different from each other in WKY and SHR. These results suggest that the CaM activator level is regulated by the dietary sodium and calcium in the kidney of normotensive rats and that the hypertensive rats have an increase in the CaM activator level. 1. Introduction The calmodulin (CaM) activator is a newly-discovered protein that activates CaM, the CaM binding protein. CaM is a ubiquitous protein that is involved in a number of biological processes such as cell growth, cell differentiation, and enzyme regulation. CaM has been found in the kidney and heart of various species, and it is expressed in a variety of tissues. It has been reported that CaM is synthesized in the kidney in response to a number of stimuli such as sodium and water deprivation, and that its level is increased in the kidney of hypertensive rats. 2. Materials and methods The materials used in this study were 1) Wistar, WKY, and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and 2) Dahl rats, and 3) male Sprague-Dawley rats.

      "Reference Text: Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets. We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs. Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood. Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. \n",

      "Reference Text: P-31 spectroscopy study of response of superficial human tumors to therapy. Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was measured. The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied. The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15). The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09). Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy. Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size. In four patients, PME/ATP increased transiently during periods when tumor size remained constant. \n",

Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was observed by conventional methods. The tumors were studied before and after treatment with 1,000 rads of gamma radiation or 5,000 rads of electron beam. Spectra were obtained from 2-mm-thick sections of tumor tissue at the time of biopsy. Spectra were analyzed using a computerized program to determine the total phosphorus concentration and the concentration of phosphorus in the phosphocreatine fraction. The phosphorus concentration was correlated with the tumor size and the tumor volume, and the phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction was correlated with the tumor volume. The phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction was also correlated with the response to treatment. The phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction was a better predictor of response to therapy than was the tumor volume. The phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction was also a better predictor of response to treatment than was the tumor volume. 1,000 rads of gamma radiation or 5,000 rads of electron beam produced a decrease in the phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction and an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction. These changes were correlated with a decrease in the tumor volume. The phosphorus concentration in the phosphocreatine fraction was not correlated with tumor size or response to treatment.

We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences.

Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. \n",

      "Reference Text: Psychological outcomes of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer outside a clinical trial OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial. \n",

METHODS--One hundred and twenty-six women with early breast cancer were evaluated before and after surgery by means of a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS--The questionnaire was completed by 112 women who had mastectomy and 14 who had breast conservation surgery. The psychological outcome of the two groups was compared. Women who had breast conservation surgery had a lower frequency of anxiety, depression, and somatization than those who had mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS--Women with early breast cancer who underwent breast conservation surgery had a lower frequency of psychological problems than women who had mastectomy. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that the psychological outcome of breast conservation surgery is better than that of mastectomy. 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 33: 163-168, 1992. 0 1992 Wiley-L\n",

Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L.

Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial.

The regression of plaque area was more pronounced in patients receiving diet and combined drug regimens than in patients receiving diet alone (p less than 0.01). Regression of plaque area was observed in all patients receiving diet and combined drug regimens. The regression of plaque area was independent of the initial plaque area and was significantly correlated with the initial plasma low-density lipoprotein level (p less than 0.05). Regression of plaque area was significantly correlated with the reduction in plasma low-density lipoprotein level (p less than 0.05). Regression of plaque area was not significantly correlated with the reduction in plasma triglyceride level or with the plasma high-density lipoprotein level.

      "Reference Text: Should you cancel the operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection? Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical. Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI. We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience. Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events. The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status. However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1). We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure. \n",

Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples. However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body. The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch). Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other. Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence. \n",

Transpulmonic pressure gradient and pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated from the Doppler pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation. In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities. \n",

The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents. \n",

We found that Myb-expressing cells were more sensitive than leukemic cells to the inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense ODNs in both a 24-hour cell culture system and a 6-hour pulse-chase system. In contrast, Myb-expressing cells were less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of antisense ODNs than leukemic cells in a 24-hour cell culture system. These results suggest that Myb-expressing cells are more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense ODNs than leukemic cells, which may be a reflection of the differential dependence of the two cell types on Myb.  (12 references)\n",

After endocardial mapping was used to identify the \"tachycardia-related\" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action.

Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage. \n",

Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors.

The prevalence of hearing loss was 2.8% for all miners, 2.6% for those exposed to the dust, and 2.2% for those not exposed. The prevalence of neurological symptoms was 2.8% for all miners, 1.8% for those exposed to the dust, and 1.7% for those not exposed. The prevalence of neurological symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed group than in the unexposed group. In the exposed group, the prevalence of hearing loss was significantly higher in the exposed than in the unexposed group, and the prevalence of neurological symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed than in the unexposed group. The prevalence of neurological symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed group than in the unexposed group. The results of the study suggest that exposure to aluminium powder has a detrimental effect on the health of miners. The prevalence of neurological symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed group than in the unexposed group. 1983.

      "Reference Text: Neuropsychological performance in medicated and unmedicated patients with Tourette's disorder. OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been no formal investigations of neuropsychological performance in patients with Tourette's disorder who are taking psychotropic medications. The authors conducted this study to provide such information. METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients 6-18 years old who met DSM-III-R criteria for Tourette's disorder; 51 of these patients were taking neuroleptic medications and 45 were not. The groups were well matched with regard to age, sex, education, and duration of symptoms. Each group was given a complete neuropsychological test battery as well as instruments rating symptoms of Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive characteristics, and other behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: The patients taking medications did not differ from those not taking medications on any of the neuropsychological, intellectual, or educational measures. In addition, the groups did not differ with regard to level of Tourette's disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that patients with Tourette's disorder who do not experience intolerable side effects from neuroleptic medications are able to perform on educational, intellectual, and neuropsychological tests at a level comparable to that of unmedicated patients. These results have positive implications for patients with Tourette's disorder who respond to neuroleptic medications. \n",

METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients with Tourette's disorder (Tourette's syndrome, 67; Tourette's disorder, 29) who were taking psychotropic medications. All patients were given a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: The results of the neuropsychological evaluations of the patients who were taking psychotropic medications were compared with those of a group of 48 patients who were not taking medications. The results showed that the patients who were taking psychotropic medications performed significantly worse than the patients who were not taking medications on the tests of attention, memory, and language.

Severe spasm of gastroepiploic bypass occurred. Modification of guide catheter position is suggested to avoid inducing gastroepiploic bypass spasm. 1. Introduction. Gastroepiploic bypass (GEB) is a useful surgical approach to the coronary circulation. However, the technique of PTCA of GEB has not been reported. We report a technique for PTCA of GEB using standard PTCA devices. 2. Case report. A 66-year-old man underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for left main coronary artery stenosis, with a 3-vessel bypass to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The bypass was performed through the right internal thoracic artery (RITA) and the right gastroepiploic artery (GEA). The GEA was cut and sutured to the RITA. The LAD was reconstructed with the saphenous vein graft. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2. On postoperative day 7, he complained of severe chest pain. He underwent angiography, which showed severe spasm of the GEA. The spasm was relieved by dilatation with a 5.5-mm balloon catheter. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9. 3. Discussion. GEB is a useful surgical approach to the coronary circulation. However, the technique of PTCA of GEB has not been reported. In this report, we describe a technique for PTCA of GEB using standard PTCA devices. 4. Conclusion. PTCA of GEB is feasible using standard PTCA devices. 5. References. 1.

Leukemic cells from a patient with Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had a normal karyotype.

The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22. Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22. \n",

      "Reference Text: Specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days. The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1). \n",
      "Generated Text: Specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days. The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet did not alter the hypertensive response to phenylephrine in DS or DR rats. The vascular responses to the vasodilators nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside were similar in DS and DR rats. However, the vascular responses to acetylcholine and endothelin were much more exaggerated in the DS rats, which had a 4.5-fold greater increase in mesenteric vascular resistance (P < 0.01) and a 3.0-fold greater increase in mesenteric blood flow (P < 0.05) after acetylcholine infusion. The mesenteric vascular bed of DS rats also had a 3.0-fold greater increase in mesenteric blood flow after endothelin infusion (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the exaggerated mesenteric vascular responses in DS rats may be mediated by a specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed to endothelin. 1. Introduction The pathogenesis of hypertension is not fully understood. The hypertensive response to various stimuli may be mediated by different mechanisms. The vascular responses to acetylcholine, endothelin, and nitroglycerin in normal and hypertensive rats are similar. However, the vascular responses to the vasodilators nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside are exaggerated in salt-sensitive rats. This exaggerated vascular response to nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside may be mediated by a specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed to these vasodilators. 2. Methods The mesenteric vascular bed of rats was perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution (4 ml/min) at 37 degrees C. The mesenteric vascular bed was then isolated by cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. The mesenteric vascular bed was superfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 10(-6) M acetylcholine, 10(-6) M endothelin-1, or 10(-5) M sodium nitroprusside. The mesenteric vascular\n",

The first known case is reported of extramedullary blastic transformation in a patient with medullary complete cytogenetic response (0% Ph-positive metaphases) to IFN-A. Four episodes of extramedullary blast crisis have occurred in this patient. The first three episodes were lymphoid by morphology and cytochemical stains. Molecular analysis confirmed breakpoint cluster region rearrangement. The most recent transformation was myeloid in nature and involved bone and pulmonary parenchyma.

      "Reference Text: Estimation of myocardial infarct size with ultrasonic tissue characterization. BACKGROUND. Ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can distinguish normal from infarcted myocardium. Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter. The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours. A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction. Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively. The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x). Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk). However, UTC underestimated both infarct size and area at risk. CONCLUSIONS. Ultrasonic tissue characterization may provide a reliable, noninvasive method to estimate myocardial infarct size. \n",

The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the loss of this variation indicates loss of contractile function. The magnitude of the variation in backscatter can be used to estimate the size of the infarct. METHODS. UTC measurements were made in 16 dogs with acute myocardial infarction and in 14 dogs with acute myocardial infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy. In the dogs with acute myocardial infarction, UTC measurements were made before and after intravenous administration of dobutamine. In the dogs with acute myocardial infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy, UTC measurements were made before and after intravenous administration of dobutamine and dipyridamole. The infarct size was estimated by the percentage reduction in the area under the cyclic variation of backscatter. RESULTS. The cyclic variation of backscatter was significantly reduced in the dogs with acute myocardial infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy compared with the dogs with acute myocardial infarction.

The purpose of the study was to assess the isokinetic and isometric strength and power profile of the knees of 48 patients who had a previous second-degree sprain (partial tear) of the medial ligament compartment, the most common knee ligament injury in sports. The CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used in the measurements. On an average of 8 yr after the injury, the mean strength deficit of the injured knees was minimal: 4 +/- 5% (range 0-28%) in extension and 2 +/- 4% (0-20%) in flexion. The average strength score (max. 100 points) was 90 +/- 11 (56-100), representing an excellent classification. In hamstrings, the relative strength deficit increased significantly with a higher speed of isokinetic movement (P less than 0.05). Compared with the strength parameters (peak torques), the other functional parameters of the injured knees (total work, average power, and peak torque acceleration energy) showed some but not significantly greater deficits (hamstrings 9-11%, quadriceps 6-8%). In conclusion, the general thigh muscle function in knees with old second-degree sprain of the medial ligament compartment appears good and acceptable, but the strength deficits are systematically greater in higher speeds of isokinetic movement. Therefore, rehabilitation utilizing high speed extension and flexion exercises is recommended. \n",

The results were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance. The results showed a significant difference between the control group and the group of patients with partial tear of the medial ligament compartment. The isokinetic results showed that the patients with partial tear of the medial ligament compartment had a significantly lower knee extension torque at 60 degrees of flexion. The isometric results showed that the patients with partial tear of the medial ligament compartment had a significantly lower knee flexion torque at 60 degrees of flexion.

The most common injury is a partial tear of the medial ligament compartment, which is the ligament that connects the femur to the tibia. This injury is caused by a twisting force of the knee that is directed toward the lateral side. The most common mechanism is a direct blow to the lateral side of the knee, such as a fall or a direct blow to the lateral side of the knee from a horse. The most common symptom is a popping sensation in the knee. The most common complication is a medial meniscus tear, which can occur as a result of the medial meniscus being torn by the force of the injury. The most common complication of a\n",

Evidence from studies of experimental animals indicates that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alters behavioral and electrographic seizure activity. We report on effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in five patients with medically intractable seizures as part of a clinical trial of chronic vagal stimulation for control of epilepsy. The mechanism of action of the vagal antiepileptic effect is unknown, and it is hoped that analysis of electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve stimulation will help elucidate which brain areas are affected. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator. Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied. Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution. Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes. Muscle paralysis confirms this observation. Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep. \n",

The vagus nerve was stimulated at frequencies between 20 and 100 Hz and in a variety of ways, including direct current stimulation, pulsed electrical stimulation, and intracerebral microelectrode recording. Two patients were found to have seizure activity suppressed by stimulation of the vagus nerve at 50 Hz, and one patient had seizure suppression at 100 Hz. The stimulation was found to be well tolerated. The vagus nerve stimulation technique was well tolerated and did not induce seizures in any of the five patients. We conclude that vagus nerve stimulation is a promising therapy for medically intractable seizures and that it should be further evaluated in a multicenter trial. 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

      "Reference Text: Effects of inflammatory mediators on the responsiveness of isolated human airways to methacholine. Several studies have suggested that in asthmatics the quantities of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that are present in the airway lumen are related to the degree of bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine (MCh). Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments. Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied. Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M). With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA). This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA). These data indicate that mediator-induced muscle hypersensitivity can explain a small part of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to inhaled MCh as observed in asthma. \n",

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that in human airways, these mediators may be responsible for a reduction in responsiveness to methacholine. The effects of these mediators were examined in isolated human airways from 10 asthmatics and 9 normal controls. The airways were stimulated with methacholine and the resulting airway resistance was measured. The airway resistance was measured at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 Hz. The airways were also exposed to 100 micrograms/ml histamine, 1.0 micrograms/ml TxA2, 0.5 micrograms/ml PGD2, 0.5 micrograms/ml PGF2 alpha, 0.1 micrograms/ml LTC4, or 1.0 micrograms/ml leukotriene B4.

The airway resistance in the asthmatic group was significantly reduced in response to all of the inflammatory mediators, except for leukotriene B4. The airway resistance in the normal group was significantly reduced in response to all of the inflammatory mediators except for histamine. The present results indicate that the inflammatory mediators may contribute to the reduction in responsiveness to methacholine in human airways. The effects of these mediators may be mediated through the release of a number of mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, PGs, and TxA2, and the reduction in responsiveness to methacholine may be due to a reduction in the number of airway receptors, which is mediated by the release of histamine, leukotrienes, PGs, and TxA2. 1 references. 2\n",

      "Reference Text: Hemodynamic effects of H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. Clinical studies with rapidly administered intravenous cimetidine in critically ill patients have demonstrated a depression in blood pressure in up to 75 percent of patients. Ranitidine, also studied in this setting, does not appear to induce similar hemodynamic changes. The newer H2RAs, famotidine and nizatidine, have not been evaluated in critically ill patients. \n",

Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) often are administered to intensive care unit patients in an attempt to reduce gastric acidity and to prevent stress-related mucosal damage. These agents have an extremely low overall incidence and severity of adverse reactions; however, hemodynamically significant hypotension has been noted. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but may be related to the inhibition of prostaglandins. The goal of this study was to determine whether the hemodynamic effects of H2RAs were related to the inhibition of prostaglandins. We administered 10 mg of cimetidine, 10 mg of ranitidine, 10 mg of famotidine, 10 mg of cimetidine plus 10 mg of ranitidine, and 10 mg of famotidine plus 10 mg of cimetidine to 12 healthy subjects. Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma prostaglandin E2 concentrations were measured before and after administration of the H2RAs. The plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) by all H2RAs. The hemodynamic effects of H2RAs were not related to the plasma prostaglandin E2 concentrations. These findings suggest that the hemodynamic effects of H2RAs are not related to prostaglandin inhibition. 1 1991 American College of Chest Physicians.

      "Reference Text: Factors determining improvement in left ventricular function after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: primacy of baseline ejection fraction. Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage. \n",

Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be related to the baseline ejection fraction. To determine whether baseline ejection fraction is the primary determinant of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, 48 patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied. Baseline ejection fraction was 24 +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM) and the peak ejection fraction was 46 +/- 11% (mean +/- SEM) after reperfusion therapy. The peak ejection fraction was not correlated with the baseline ejection fraction (r = 0.23, p = 0.4). The peak ejection fraction was correlated with the peak creatine kinase level (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), peak serum creatinine (r = 0.54, p < 0.001), and peak serum potassium (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). The peak ejection fraction was not correlated with the peak serum creatine kinase level (r = 0.21, p = 0.16), peak serum potassium (r = 0.13, p = 0.39), or peak serum creatinine (r = 0.16, p = 0.33).

      "Reference Text: Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis. Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. \n",

Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular renin may be an endogenous factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension. 1. Introduction. The renin-angiotensin system is a key regulatory mechanism in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, the relative contribution of the vascular renin and the renal renin to the elevated blood pressure is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether the vascular renin is derived from the plasma or from the aortic wall. 2. Methods. Aortic renin was measured by radioimmunoassay in 16 patients with essential hypertension and in 13 normotensive control subjects. 3. Results. The vascular renin activity was significantly elevated in the hypertensive patients (mean +/- SEM, 0.21 +/- 0.02 ng/ml/min) compared to the control subjects (0.07 +/- 0.01 ng/ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the hypertensive patients (0.41 +/- 0.02 ng/ml/min) than in the control subjects (0.20 +/- 0.02 ng/ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The vascular renin activity correlated better with blood pressure than did the plasma renin activity (r = 0.61; p less than 0.001). The plasma renin activity correlated better with the blood pressure than did the vascular renin activity (r = 0.55; p less than 0.001). 4. Conclusion. The vascular renin is derived from the aortic wall and is associated with elevated blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. 5. Acknowledgments.

The operative techniques were largely standardized. Patients were studied by means of a limited barium enema on the ninth or tenth postoperative day. The data have been analyzed for leakage rate (clinical and roentgenologic), other complications and degree of experience of the surgeon. Eleven patients were excluded from the analysis because the selected technique could not be carried out; of these, eight were in the stapled group in which it was possible to perform a sutured anastomosis. There were no instances in which it was possible to staple but not possible to suture. The remaining three exclusions were patients in whom either a coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure was performed. There was no over-all difference in the leakage rate--roentgenologic, clinical or total--between the two groups. However, when analyzed by the surgeon, the clinical leakage rate for surgeons in training was greater for sutured anastomoses than for stapled anastomoses (p = 0.053). Thus, it appears that the benefits of experience are more pronounced for sutured anastomoses but that, in experienced hands, neither technique is superior. \n",

      "Reference Text: Pneumococcal pneumonia in a rat model of cirrhosis: effects of cirrhosis on pulmonary defense mechanisms against Streptococcus pneumoniae. To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host. \n",
      "Generated Text: Pneumococcal pneumonia in a rat model of cirrhosis: effects of cirrhosis on pulmonary defense mechanisms against Streptococcus pneumoniae. To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by partial hepatectomy. The development of pneumonia was evaluated by measuring the number of viable organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, by quantifying the extent of lung edema, and by determining the lung histologic changes. Cirrhosis induced an increase in the number of viable organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a decrease in the extent of lung edema, and a significant increase in the extent of histologic lung damage.

Introduction Pneumococcal pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. 2. Pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia in cirrhotic rats. A model of pneumococcal pneumonia in cirrhotic rats was developed by the partial hepatectomy technique. Cirrhosis was produced in rats by partial hepatectomy. The development of pneumonia was evaluated by measuring the number of viable organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, by quantifying the extent of lung edema, and by determining the lung histologic changes. Cirrhosis induced an increase in the number of viable organisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a decrease in the extent of lung edema, and a significant increase in the extent of histologic lung damage. These alterations in lung defense mechanisms against pneumococcal infection were not affected by the development of ascites. These results suggest that cirrhosis enhances the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This enhanced virulence may be due to a reduction in host defense mechanisms. 3.

      "Reference Text: Latent sensitisation to respiratory syncytial virus during acute bronchiolitis and lung function after recovery. To determine whether latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) occurs after infection, 27 infants with acute bronchiolitis were studied and compared with 15 hospital controls. Blood was collected for whole blood challenge, and histamine release was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography technique with fluorometric detection. There was a significantly greater histamine release to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) in those with bronchiolitis than in controls, expressed either in amount (median 154 nmol/l compared with 104 nmol/l) or percentage release (median 20% compared with 3%). There was a significant difference between index and control groups in terms of individual histamine responses. These findings strongly suggest that infants develop latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) during the course of acute bronchiolitis. Serial lung function tests were performed in 15 infants. All infants had abnormalities of lung function at some stage, but the small numbers of subjects precluded comparison between 'sensitised' and 'non-sensitised' infants. Further study is indicated to define the relation of latent sensitisation and subsequent bronchial hyper-responsiveness after respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants. \n",

Several autoimmune sera from patients with Raynaud phenomenon decorated mammalian kinetochores and bound to a 47-kDa protein on immunoblots of nuclear lysates. Antibody affinity-purified from immunoblots of the 47-kDa band recognized kinetochores, but due to crossreaction with an 18-kDa protein, localization remains elusive. We used one of these sera to purify the antigen from HeLa cells synchronized in mitosis as a noncovalent complex with a 25-kDa protein. The antigen was released from DNA by intercalation with 25 mM chloroquine. Ion-exchange chromatography yielded the pure complex with an apparent molecular size of 68 kDa, which was separated into its components by gel filtration in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the 47-kDa protein gave two main spots of pI 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Posttranslational modification is indicated by additional antigenic spots, by lack of a free alpha-amino group, and by chromatographic behavior of peptides on reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence for 205 residues of the 47-kDa protein has been established. This sequence is highly homologous with the translated reading frame of RCC1, a gene reportedly involved in regulating onset of mammalian chromosome condensation. \n",

To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups.

Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10.

Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia.

We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 10 minutes of regional ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In controls reperfused with oxygenated solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg), 92% of hearts developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first 20 seconds of reperfusion, whereas in hearts reperfused with hypoxic solution (Po2 9.3-12.2 mm Hg), the incidence of VF was only 17% (p less than 0.05). Subsequent readmission of control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) to the latter group led, within 20 seconds, to the appearance of VF in seven of the 10 hearts (70%) that had not previously fibrillated. To examine whether hypoxic reperfusion had prevented VF or merely delayed its onset, the studies were repeated in separate groups of hearts with the duration of hypoxic reperfusion extended to 5 minutes. In addition, to examine the partial pressure dependence of the relation, the Po2 in the reperfusion solution was set at one of five different levels: greater than 600, 150-192.7, 69-85.6, 9.2-14.8, or 0.0 mm Hg. It was found that hypoxia merely delayed VF onset by 20-40 seconds and did not significantly reduce the incidence of VF, which was 83%, 92%, 67%, 58%, and 58%, respectively. This indicated that readmission of oxygen is unnecessary for the initiation of VF during reperfusion. The hearts that reverted to sinus rhythm during the ensuing 5 minutes (n = 8, 4, 5, 9, and 8, respectively) were used to assess the arrhythmogenic consequences of readmission of oxygen. When control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) was readmitted, new episodes of VF were elicited within 20 seconds in a manner that was inversely proportional to the preceding Po2 (p less than 0.05), the incidence of new episodes of VF being 0%, 0%, 40%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. The arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was not the result of a sudden increase in heart rate, because a similar arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was seen in separate groups of hearts that were paced (350 beats/min) throughout hypoxia and readmission of oxygen. In conclusion, readmission of flow and readmission of oxygen are independent determinants of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \n",

We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts were perfused with an oxygenated Krebs solution and then subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. During reperfusion, a significant increase in the production of oxygen-derived free radicals was observed, as measured by the increase in the concentration of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. The increase in the concentration of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein was directly proportional to the increase in the duration of reperfusion. In the presence of a high concentration of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein, the arrhythmia was initiated by an increase in the duration of reperfusion. In contrast, in the presence of a low concentration of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein, the arrhythmia was initiated by a decrease in the duration of reperfusion. These results suggest that the readmission of oxygen is an important determinant of the arrhythmia produced by reperfusion. 2,7-Dichlorofluorescein was also used to examine the role of oxygen-derived free radicals in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.

The pain symptoms can be very disabling, and the possibility of fertility loss is a major concern. In the past, the only treatment for recurrent endometriosis was hysterectomy. However, in recent years, conservative surgery has been used in the treatment of recurrent endometriosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. 2. Material and methods We evaluated 42 women who underwent repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis. The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years.

The patients were classified as follows: group 1: patients with no pain relief, group 2: patients with moderate pain relief, and group 3: patients with severe pain relief. The pain relief was evaluated by the patients themselves using a pain scale of 0 to 10.

Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug. \n",

The mean albendazole plasma levels were 0.30 +/- 0.09 micrograms/ml before and 0.15 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml after 6 days of albendazole therapy. The results indicate that dexamethasone decreases the plasma levels of albendazole in patients with neurocysticercosis.

Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance. The effect of continuous infusion of interleukin 2 plus intramuscular interferon alfa on natural immune status was, therefore, analyzed in eight patients with head and neck cancer. Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment. The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered. The demonstrated capacity to modulate natural immune function supports the potential use of interleukin 2-containing regimens as a preventive measure against metastatic disease in patients with head and neck cancer. \n",

Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance. The effect of interleukin 2 and interferon alfa on natural killer cell function was evaluated in 16 patients with head and neck cancer. The natural killer cell activity of 10 patients was measured before and after 10 days of treatment with either interleukin 2 or interferon alfa. Natural killer cell activity was evaluated by the 51Cr release assay. In addition, the effect of the treatment on natural killer cell activity was compared with that of the patients' pretreatment natural killer cell activity. The pretreatment natural killer cell activity was significantly reduced in the patients with head and neck cancer. The 51Cr release assay demonstrated that the patients' natural killer cell activity was restored to normal levels after 10 days of treatment with either interleukin 2 or interferon alfa. These results suggest that interleukin 2 and interferon alfa may have a therapeutic significance in the treatment of head and neck cancer patients with deficient natural immunity. 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 71: 111-119. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 1992. 199\n",

A report by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. This paper examines a process for evaluating clinical effectiveness and developing recommendations in which systematic methods are used to review evidence from published clinical research and to reach sound conclusions about appropriate medical policy. The methodology addresses four important components of the analytic process: (1) the criteria that must be satisfied for a clinical practice to be considered effective; (2) proper methods for reviewing evidence from published clinical research to determine whether a clinical practice meets these criteria (including methods for performing comprehensive literature reviews, for judging the quality of individual studies, and for synthesizing or pooling the results of multiple studies); (3) theoretical and practical concerns in translating the results of the scientific review into sound clinical practice recommendations; and (4) the importance of documentation, guidelines, and other safeguards to minimize the effect the reviewers themselves have on the objectivity and consistency of the analytic methods. \n",

Twenty five patients had attacks accompanied by headache, and seven gave a history of common migraine. Only four of 27 angiograms were abnormal; no operable carotid lesion was demonstrated. Over a mean follow up period of 10 years stroke or myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in all four patients who presented major cerebrovascular risk factors, but in only two of the remaining 42 patients. Thus irrespective of age thromboembolic TIA is a harbinger of stroke or AMI. However, most TIAs under the age of 40 years are caused by a non-embolic benign vascular disorder. The clinical characteristics, long-term prognosis, and possible pathogenesis, for such attacks are often indistinguishable from those of classical migraine.

The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive. By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia. Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively.

The two electrocardiographic systems were compared in terms of the incidence of electrocardiographic changes of ischemia and the occurrence of electrocardiographic changes of ischemia in patients who were judged to have perioperative myocardial ischemia. The incidence of electrocardiographic changes of ischemia was significantly higher with the V5 lead than with the CM5 lead (P less than 0.0001). The incidence of electrocardiographic changes of ischemia was also significantly higher with the V5 lead than with the CM5 lead in patients who were judged to have perioperative myocardial ischemia (P less than 0.0001). The authors conclude that the incidence of electrocardiographic changes of ischemia detected by the CM5 lead was significantly higher than that detected by the V5 lead in patients who were judged to have perioperative myocardial ischemia. This difference may be due to the greater sensitivity of the V5 lead to the detection of ischemia. The authors suggest that the V5 lead may be more sensitive than the CM5 lead in detecting perioperative myocardial ischemia. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55: 1353-1359, 1995. 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 55\n",

STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies examining caffeine as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias and a selection of basic science experiments to illustrate caffeine's effects in vitro. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all available clinical data pertaining to caffeine as a cause of arrhythmias were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: In one electrophysiologic study, caffeine was associated with an increased susceptibility to provoked cardiac arrhythmias. In five placebo-controlled trials, caffeine in doses up to 500 mg daily (equivalent to 5 to 6 cups of coffee) did not increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias. One large epidemiologic study reported an increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in persons consuming 9 or more cups of coffee daily.
